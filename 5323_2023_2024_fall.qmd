#### Course Overview
This course is an introduction to the use of data science and machine learning in quantitative finance.  Emphasis will be placed on the implementation of models in code, but there will also be treatment of some of the mathematical underpinnings of the models and techniques. By the end of the course, students should be able to apply a variety of techniques to a given problem, and to give some comparative assessment of model performance.

***

#### Hy-Flex

In lieu of in-person meetings on Thursdays, there will be a hy-flex assignment each week.  Most of these will consist of tutorials for you to work through on your own time.  However, there will be other formats sprinkled in as well.



***

#### Programming
Most of your time inside and outside of class will be spent programming.  It is a requirement that all programming will be done with Python in Jupyter Notebooks.  I will use JupyterLab as my IDE and I recommend you do the same.  

<!-- We will spend a portion of the first class making sure everyone is up and running with Python and JupterLab. -->

***

#### Canvas
I will make heavy use of the course Canvas for organizing the course.  All course materials including tutorials, homework, and reading materials will be available there.  All assignments will be posted and turned-in there as well.

***
#### Grading

Your letter grade will be based entirely on the individual homework assignments and group projects.  There will be no midterms or final exam.

Homeworks will be short data analysis programming tasks that are to be completed in the form of a self-contained Jupyter Notebook (Python).  For individual assignments, you can discuss homework assignments with your classmates, but you are expected to code up your assignments by yourself.  Cheating will result in all involved parties receiving a zero.

Group projects will be larger data analysis tasks with a presentation component.  You will also turn in a self-contained Jupyter Notebook for these.

Late homeworks will be penalized by 50%.  Late projects will be penalized by 20%.

<!-- In lieu of a final exam, we will spend 30 minutes during the final class discussing interview questions related to machine learning. -->


***
